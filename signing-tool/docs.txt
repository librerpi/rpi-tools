RPi4 B1 silicon introduces a new boot image format:
Offset  Data type  Comment
 0x00   byte[n]    payload
 n      dword      n = payload size (must equal total size minus 284)
 n+4    dword      key index (0 .. 3)
                   a key is DISABLED if the corresponding OTP boot
                   mode bit is set (bits 15 .. 18)
 n+8    byte[256]  RSA signature
 n+264  byte[20]   old-style checksum (ignored)
The RSA signature is interpreted as a 2048-bit big-endian integer, which is decrypted using the exponent value of 65537 and one of the 4 public key modulos and exporting the result again as a 2048-bit big-endian integer.

the new scheme is controlled by bit 14 in the OTP boot mode register
this bit is ZERO on my RPi4 with B1 silicon, which means it still uses the old scheme
I haven't found the courage to program the bit
there's no official way to do that, anyway


the bcm2711C0 rsa validation routine will:
sha1 sum the payload+payloadsize+keyindex
confirm that the payloadsize+footsize == actualsize
confirm the keyindex is in the range stated above
do something with the key and sha1 hash
